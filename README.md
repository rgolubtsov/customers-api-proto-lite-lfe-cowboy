# Customers API Lite microservice prototype :small_blue_diamond: <img src="https://blog.lfe.io/assets/images/posts/LispFlavoredErlang-medium-square.png" style="border:0;width:32px" alt="LFE (Lisp Flavoured Erlang)" />

**A daemon written in LFE (Lisp Flavoured Erlang), designed and intended to be run as a microservice,
<br />implementing a special Customers API prototype with a smart yet simplified data scheme**

**Rationale:** This project is a *direct* **[LFE](https://lfe.io "Lisp Flavoured Erlang")** port of the earlier developed **Customers API Lite microservice prototype**, written in Clojure using **[http-kit](https://http-kit.github.io "Simple, high-performance event-driven HTTP client+server for Clojure")** web client/server library, and tailored to be run as a microservice in a Docker container. The following description of the underlying architecture and logics has been taken **[from here](https://github.com/rgolubtsov/customers-api-proto-lite-clojure-httpkit/blob/main/README.md)** almost as is, without any principal modifications or adjustment.
